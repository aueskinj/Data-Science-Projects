### Estimands

In causal inference, **estimands** are mathematical quantities representing the causal effect we aim to estimate. For this analysis, the objective is to determine the causal effect of a binary treatment variable (`diabetesMed_binary`) on a binary outcome variable (`readmitted_binary`). Estimands formalize assumptions and methods for inference, often leveraging tools like **do-calculus**.

---

#### Types of Estimands

1. **Backdoor Estimand**:
    - **Definition**: The backdoor criterion identifies confounding variables that block all non-causal paths (backdoor paths) between the treatment and the outcome. By conditioning on these variables, the causal effect can be estimated nonparametrically.
    - **Expression**: 
      Partial derivative of E[readmitted_binary | age, race, num_medications, gender, time_in_hospital] with respect to diabetesMed_binary.
      This estimates the effect of `diabetesMed_binary` on `readmitted_binary`, controlling for confounders: age, race, number of medications, gender, and time in hospital.
    - **Assumption (Unconfoundedness)**:
      There are no unobserved confounders (`U`) affecting both the treatment and the outcome. Mathematically:
      P(readmitted_binary | diabetesMed_binary, age, race, num_medications, gender, time_in_hospital, U) = P(readmitted_binary | diabetesMed_binary, age, race, num_medications, gender, time_in_hospital).
    - **Role of Do-Calculus**: Using the backdoor adjustment rule, the interventional distribution P(readmitted_binary | do(diabetesMed_binary)) is replaced with an observational equivalent:
      P(readmitted_binary | do(diabetesMed_binary)) = Integral of P(readmitted_binary | diabetesMed_binary, confounders) * P(confounders) with respect to confounders.

---

2. **Instrumental Variable (IV) Estimand**:
    - **Definition**: IV estimands depend on an instrument—a variable that affects the treatment but has no direct influence on the outcome except through the treatment. This approach addresses scenarios where unmeasured confounders violate the unconfoundedness assumption.
    - **Result in This Case**: No valid instrumental variables were identified in the dataset, indicating this method is not applicable.

---

3. **Frontdoor Estimand**:
    - **Definition**: The frontdoor criterion applies when mediators transmit the causal effect from the treatment to the outcome. It allows for causal estimation even with unobserved confounders if the mediators meet specific conditions.
    - **Result in This Case**: No mediators satisfying the frontdoor criterion were identified in the dataset.
    - **Role of Do-Calculus**: If mediators existed, the causal effect could be decomposed as:
      P(readmitted_binary | do(diabetesMed_binary)) = Integral of Integral of P(readmitted_binary | mediator) * P(mediator | do(diabetesMed_binary)) with respect to the mediator.

---

#### Conclusion

The analysis identifies the **backdoor estimand** as the only viable approach for estimating the **nonparametric average treatment effect (ATE)** in this context. This method leverages observed confounders and assumes unconfoundedness. The absence of instrumental variables and frontdoor mediators limits the use of alternative causal estimation techniques.

### CausalEffectEstimation

Once the estimands are defined, the next step is **estimation**—the process of using data to compute an estimate of the causal effect. Estimation bridges the gap between theoretical causal definitions and practical application, translating assumptions into actionable insights. Here’s a breakdown of estimation in the context of causal inference:

#### Backdoor Estimation

For the backdoor estimand, the causal effect is estimated by conditioning on confounders. This often involves one or more of the following approaches:

1. **Regression-Based Estimation**:
   - A common method involves fitting a regression model (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression) with `readmitted_binary` as the dependent variable and `diabetesMed_binary` and confounders (`age`, `race`, `num_medications`, `gender`, and `time_in_hospital`) as independent variables.
   - The coefficient of `diabetesMed_binary` represents the causal effect, assuming the model is correctly specified and all confounders are included.

2. **Propensity Score Matching (PSM)**:
   - **Definition**: Propensity scores represent the probability of receiving the treatment (`diabetesMed_binary`) given the confounders.
   - Steps:
     1. Estimate propensity scores using a logistic regression model: P(diabetesMed_binary | confounders).
     2. Match individuals with similar propensity scores from treatment and control groups.
     3. Estimate the treatment effect by comparing outcomes (`readmitted_binary`) between the matched groups.

3. **Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW)**:
   - **Definition**: IPW assigns weights to observations based on the inverse of their probability of receiving the treatment (or not receiving it), balancing the treatment and control groups.
   - Weight Formula:
     - For treated: \( w_i = 1 / P(diabetesMed_binary = 1 | \text{confounders}) \)
     - For untreated: \( w_i = 1 / (1 - P(diabetesMed_binary = 1 | \text{confounders})) \)
   - These weights adjust for confounding, allowing for unbiased causal effect estimation.

4. **Stratification/Standardization**:
   - Divide the dataset into strata based on confounder values or propensity scores.
   - Estimate the causal effect within each stratum and combine these estimates (e.g., via weighted averaging) to obtain an overall treatment effect.

---

#### Instrumental Variable (IV) Estimation

Although no instrumental variables were found in this case, IV estimation is crucial when unmeasured confounding exists. Estimation typically involves:

1. **Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS)**:
   - Stage 1: Regress the treatment variable (`diabetesMed_binary`) on the instrument and confounders to compute predicted treatment values.
   - Stage 2: Regress the outcome (`readmitted_binary`) on the predicted treatment values from Stage 1.
   - The coefficient of the predicted treatment variable in Stage 2 represents the causal effect.

---

#### Frontdoor Estimation

Since no mediators satisfying the frontdoor criterion were identified, estimation cannot proceed using this method. However, if valid mediators existed:

1. **Decomposition of Effects**:
   - Estimate \( P(\text{mediator} | \text{diabetesMed_binary}) \) (the effect of treatment on the mediator).
   - Estimate \( P(\text{readmitted_binary} | \text{mediator}) \) (the effect of the mediator on the outcome).
   - Combine these estimates to calculate the total causal effect:
     \[
     P(\text{readmitted_binary} | \text{do}(\text{diabetesMed_binary})) = \int P(\text{readmitted_binary} | \text{mediator}) P(\text{mediator} | \text{do}(\text{diabetesMed_binary})) d\text{mediator}
     \]

---

#### Challenges in Estimation

1. **Model Misspecification**: Regression models assume correct functional forms for relationships between variables. Incorrect assumptions can bias estimates.
2. **Unmeasured Confounding**: The validity of backdoor estimation hinges on capturing all relevant confounders. Missing confounders lead to biased results.
3. **Data Limitations**: Small sample sizes or imbalance between treatment groups can reduce estimation precision.
4. **Overlapping Support**: Methods like PSM and IPW require sufficient overlap in the distribution of propensity scores between treatment and control groups.

---

#### Software and Tools

Modern tools facilitate causal estimation, including:
- **Python**: Libraries like `CausalInference`, `DoWhy`, and `EconML` support causal analysis.
- **R**: Packages like `MatchIt`, `twang`, and `ivreg` are widely used for propensity score and instrumental variable analysis.

---

#### Conclusion

Estimation transforms the theoretical definitions of estimands into actionable results by applying statistical techniques and causal inference methods. The backdoor adjustment is the primary estimation approach here, using observed confounders to estimate the causal effect of `diabetesMed_binary` on `readmitted_binary`. The process underscores the importance of robust data and valid assumptions in causal inference.

### Refutation

In causal inference, **refutation** refers to the process of testing the robustness of a causal estimate by challenging the assumptions that underlie it. Refutation helps to determine whether the estimated causal effect is reliable and whether the methods used to estimate it hold up under different conditions or alternative assumptions. It is a key part of ensuring the validity and credibility of causal claims.

Refutation techniques aim to expose weaknesses in the causal assumptions, identify potential biases, and provide evidence of the robustness of the causal effect. The goal is to critically assess the causal estimate by exploring different model specifications, alternative data treatments, and assumptions.

#### Types of Refutation in Causal Inference

1. **Assumption Testing (Unconfoundedness and Beyond)**

   One of the core assumptions in causal inference is **unconfoundedness**, which states that there are no unmeasured confounders that affect both the treatment and outcome. To test this assumption, researchers often:
   
   - **Conduct sensitivity analysis**: Assess how the causal estimate changes when varying assumptions about confounders or the functional form of the model.
   - **Check for omitted variables**: Evaluate whether important confounders are missing from the model. This can be done by examining residuals or conducting tests for potential confounders.
   - **Instrumental variables (IV)**: If an instrumental variable is available, test whether it meets the assumptions required for valid IV analysis, particularly whether it is correlated with the treatment but not directly with the outcome.

   In the case of the **backdoor criterion**, the refutation process involves ensuring that all relevant confounders are included. If this assumption fails, the causal estimate may be biased.

2. **Placebo Tests**

   A **placebo test** involves applying the same causal method to an outcome variable that should not be affected by the treatment. If the causal estimate for this "placebo" outcome is significantly different from zero, it suggests that the causal estimate for the actual outcome may be spurious.
   
   For example, if we estimate the causal effect of `diabetesMed_binary` on `readmitted_binary`, a placebo test might involve checking the effect of `diabetesMed_binary` on an unrelated outcome, such as `age`. The lack of a causal relationship in the placebo test strengthens the original claim.

3. **Falsification Tests**

   **Falsification tests** involve testing a causal model with data or assumptions that should logically contradict the causal hypothesis. A result that contradicts expectations provides evidence that the original causal inference may be invalid.
   
   For example, if we claim that `diabetesMed_binary` affects `readmitted_binary`, we could test the effect of `diabetesMed_binary` on a known exogenous outcome, such as `time_in_hospital`. If no significant effect is found, this strengthens the claim that the original causal estimate is likely valid.

4. **Sensitivity Analysis**

   **Sensitivity analysis** tests how robust the causal estimate is to changes in key assumptions, model specifications, and possible confounders. By varying assumptions and input data, researchers can assess how sensitive the results are and determine whether the conclusions would change under different conditions.

   - **Bounding techniques**: These are used to assess how much unmeasured confounding would be needed to overturn the estimated causal effect.
   - **Alternative models**: Test the causal relationship under different statistical models (e.g., linear vs. non-linear) or methods (e.g., propensity score matching vs. regression).

   In practice, sensitivity analysis could involve assessing whether adding or removing specific covariates changes the estimated effect. If the effect is stable, the causal estimate is considered more robust.

5. **Randomization Inference**

   When using observational data, refutation can be done through **randomization inference**. This involves simulating random assignments of the treatment to assess the likelihood of observing the estimated causal effect under the null hypothesis that no causal effect exists.

   - This is particularly useful in natural experiments or observational studies where the treatment assignment is not random but could be considered random under certain assumptions (e.g., an instrumental variable that is random with respect to the outcome).
   - The idea is to randomly assign the treatment in a simulation and compare the simulated results to the observed causal effect.

6. **Overfitting and Out-of-Sample Validation**

   **Overfitting** occurs when a model is too complex, fitting noise in the data rather than the true underlying relationships. Refutation can involve testing whether the model overfits:
   
   - Split the data into training and validation sets.
   - Estimate the causal effect on the training set and evaluate the model’s performance on the validation set.
   
   If the model performs well on the training data but poorly on the validation data, it suggests overfitting, which would undermine the robustness of the causal estimate.

#### Example of Refutation with Backdoor Adjustment

In the case of estimating the causal effect of `diabetesMed_binary` on `readmitted_binary` using the backdoor adjustment method, several refutation techniques could be employed:

1. **Test for unmeasured confounders**: You might perform a sensitivity analysis to determine how much an unobserved confounder would need to influence both the treatment and outcome in order to nullify the estimated effect.
   
2. **Placebo test**: Apply the same backdoor adjustment method to a placebo outcome, such as a health-related variable that should not be affected by `diabetesMed_binary`, like `age`. If a significant effect is found for this placebo outcome, it may indicate that the causal estimate is not reliable.
   
3. **Falsification test**: Test the effect of `diabetesMed_binary` on `time_in_hospital`—a variable that should not be affected by the treatment. If the treatment shows a significant effect on `time_in_hospital`, this would suggest the need to reconsider the original causal model.
   
4. **Sensitivity analysis**: Examine the effect of removing some confounders (e.g., `num_medications`) to assess the robustness of the causal effect. If the estimated treatment effect changes dramatically, it may suggest that the original model is sensitive to those confounders.

---

#### Conclusion

Refutation is an essential part of causal inference, as it allows for testing the robustness of causal estimates and assumptions. By challenging the assumptions, testing alternative models, and using different techniques such as placebo and falsification tests, sensitivity analysis, and randomization inference, we can assess the validity of our causal claims and ensure that our results are not spurious. Robust refutation strengthens the credibility of causal conclusions and helps identify the conditions under which those conclusions hold true.
